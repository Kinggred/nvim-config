## My nvim config ##

Baseline taken from https://github.com/ThePrimeagen

Althought I don't utilize Tmux in favor of Yakuake with difrent sessions in it.

### Languages ###
- Python is fully supported ( Venv with all used libraries active is required as one can imagine )
- Java - Partial - I have managed to install LSP and Formatter, the latter, just doesn't want to work.
