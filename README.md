Althought I don't utilize Tmux in favor of Yakuake with difrent sessions in it.

### Languages ###
- Python 
- Java
 Java jdtls seems to have very strict rules when it comes to showing things from gradle libs.

|Language|Status|Additional|
|---|:---:|---|
|Python|Full|Works great, requires proper venv|
|Java|Full|Linting and sudgestions work most of the time, `jdtls` does like to hang sometimes ':JdtWipeDataAndRestart' seems to help.|
